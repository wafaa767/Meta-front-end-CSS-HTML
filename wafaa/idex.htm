                    Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo. 
                    After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown, Austin and started to grow her business online. 
                    Mariana has always managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to marketing to e-commerce. 
                    However, she recently hired several artisans to help craft her designs and a young employee to help manage the company website and social media accounts.
